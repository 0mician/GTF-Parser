* What?
These 2 scripts have been developed as part of an assignement for the
Practicals of bioinformatics at the KU Leuven (Autumn 2014)

* GTF_Processing.sh
** Purpose
This script was developed to extract the following informations from a
file respecting the [[http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html][GTF Standard]]:

- count the number of unique genes present in the file
- count the number of exons for each genes (reverse and forward)
- determine the gene with the most exons

** Usage
Make sure that the script is executable (chmod +x) and that you
replace path_to_gtf_file with the correct path:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./GTF_Processing.sh path_to_gtf_file
#+END_SRC

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
![alt gtf_execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milt0n/GTF-Parser/master/img/gtf_exec.png)
#+END_SRC
* PDB_Retriever.sh
** Purpose
This script starts by retrieving unique [[http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/PDB_identification_code][PDB Id]] related to aldehyde
dehydrogenase structures in a fasta file (file: pdb_seqres.txt). Then,
it proceeds to retrieve the IDs from the [[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=download/http/index.html][RCBS website]] and saves them.

** Usage
Make sure that the script is executable (chmod +x) and that you
replace path_to_gtf_file with the correct path:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./PDB_Retriever.sh path_to_pdb-IDs.txt
#+END_SRC
** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
![alt gtf_execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milt0n/GTF-Parser/master/img/gtf_exec.png)
#+END_SRC
